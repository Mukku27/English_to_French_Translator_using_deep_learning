# English to French Translator

This repository contains a simple English to French translator implemented using a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model. It includes a dataset file (`fra.txt`) containing English and corresponding French translations, as well as a Python script (`English_to_french_translator.py`) which trains the model, makes predictions, and saves the trained model.

## Files Included:

1. `fra.txt`: This dataset file contains English sentences and their corresponding French translations. Each line represents a pair of sentences separated by a tab.

2. `English_to_french_translator.py`: This Python script contains the implementation of the English to French translation model. It includes code for data loading, preprocessing, model definition, training, and prediction.

## Implementation Details:

- The model utilizes a seq2seq architecture for translation.
- The model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras libraries.
- It preprocesses the text data by converting it to lowercase and removing punctuation.
- Tokenization is applied to both the source (French) and target (English) language sentences.
- The model architecture includes an embedding layer, LSTM layers, and a dense output layer with softmax activation.
- The training process involves splitting the data into train and test sets, compiling the model, and fitting it to the training data.
- After training, the model is used to make predictions on the test set.
- The predicted sequences are decoded to obtain the translated sentences.

## Usage:

To use the translator model:

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including TensorFlow and Keras.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Place your own English-French dataset (in the format similar to `fra.txt`) or use the provided dataset (`fra.txt`).
4. Run the `English_to_french_translator.py` script to train the model and generate translations.
5. The trained model will be saved as `seq2seq_model.h5`, which can be loaded and used for translation in any application.

## Notes:

- The seq2seq model is a powerful architecture commonly used for tasks like machine translation.
- The saved model (`seq2seq_model.h5`) can be utilized in any application by loading it using TensorFlow/Keras APIs.
